moon-earth-sun is an example project that produces a quasi-scientific paper with your name on it!

This project consists of:
* A makefile, which compiles all the sources to produce paper.pdf, the final product
* Some C souce code, which contains the model of the Moon, Earth Sun system
* A gnuplot script `plot.p' which generates the plot of the Earth and Moon's path
* A python script, which generates the paper.tex source code used to create the paper.pdf file

To create paper.pdf type `make' and press ENTER.
You'll notice a lot of extra files are produced, to delete everything that was generated from the make script run `make clean'

This project may be updated, to check for new updates, run `git pull'
